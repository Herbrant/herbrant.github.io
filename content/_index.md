Hi! I'm a PhD student at the [University of Catania (Italy)](https://www.washington.edu/) in the [Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management (QERM) program](https://quantitative.uw.edu/graduate/qerm/), part of the [Complex Ecological Systems Lab](https://complexecolab.github.io/).
I'm interested in complex systems, network science, and general patterns in movement in animals and people.
